## [0.0.8] - 2025-01-29

### Added
- **AcceptUser Type**: New preferred format for accepting invitations with `email`, `phone`, and `name` fields
- Enhanced `acceptInvitations` method to support both new User format and legacy target format

### Changed
- **DEPRECATED**: Legacy `InvitationTarget` format for `acceptInvitations` - use `AcceptUser` instead
- Internal API calls now always use User format for consistency
- Added console warnings when legacy target format is used

### Fixed
- Maintained 100% backward compatibility - existing code using legacy target format continues to work
