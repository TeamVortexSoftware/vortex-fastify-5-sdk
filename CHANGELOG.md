### Added
- **Internal Invitations**: Support for new `'internal'` delivery type via underlying Node SDK
  - Allows creating invitations with `deliveryTypes: ['internal']`
  - No email/SMS communication triggered by Vortex
  - Target value can be any customer-defined identifier
  - Useful for in-app invitation flows managed by customer's application

### Changed
- Updated dependency on `@teamvortexsoftware/vortex-node-22-sdk` to support internal invitations

## [0.0.8] - 2025-01-29

### Added
- **AcceptUser Type**: New preferred format for accepting invitations with `email`, `phone`, and `name` fields
- Enhanced `acceptInvitations` method to support both new User format and legacy target format

### Changed
- **DEPRECATED**: Legacy `InvitationTarget` format for `acceptInvitations` - use `AcceptUser` instead
- Internal API calls now always use User format for consistency
- Added console warnings when legacy target format is used

### Fixed
- Maintained 100% backward compatibility - existing code using legacy target format continues to work
